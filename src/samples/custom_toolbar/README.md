## âœ¨ Some features

1. Toolbar buttons expands on long click
2. After long press on any button, using gestures haptics play as you scrub through the items (No conflict with default list scrolling)
3. The items scale up/down as they become show/hide while scrolling.
4. Scroll Rubberbanding effect when scrolling past the top or bottom, which stretches the item's spacing out (works on iOS only)
